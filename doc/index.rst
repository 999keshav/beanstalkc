beanstalkc
==========

:mod:`beanstalkc` is a simple beanstalkd client library for Python.
`beanstalkd`_ is a simple, fast work queue service.

beanstalkc depends on `PyYAML`_, but there are ways to avoid this dependency.
See :ref:`Appendix A <tut-appendix-a>` of the tutorial for details.

beanstalkc is pure Python, and is compatible with `eventlet`_ and `gevent`_.
